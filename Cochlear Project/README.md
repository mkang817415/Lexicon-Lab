## Description

This project investigates how individuals search through memory, and how different semantic representations and search processes combine to produce search outcomes. We used a foraging model to simulate the search process and compared the model's predictions to data from normal hearing and cochlear implant participants. Additionally, to instantiate the semantic representations, we used word2vec and speech2vec models to examine the relative contributions of semantic and phonological information to the search process.
